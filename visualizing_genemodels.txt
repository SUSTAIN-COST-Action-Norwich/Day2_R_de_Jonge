## in this (short) section we will examine the various gene predictions and compare to established gene predictions as well as RNA-Seq

## For simplicity we will focus on the reference genome, MG8 (Magnaporthe oryzae strain 70-15)

## Launch IGV and head over to "Genomes" > "Create .genome file" 
### Provide a unique identifier (e.g. MG8)
### Descriptive name (e.g. Magnaporthe oryzae 70-15)
### FASTA file : browse and select the MG8_ref.fna file
### Gene file : browse and select the MG8_ref.broad.gff3 (obtained from ENSEMBLE FUNGI: http://fungi.ensembl.org/info/website/ftp/index.html)
### Click "OK"

## The genome will open and display a chromosome with gene predictions below
## Now we can import the gene predictions we prepared using augustus , as well as the RNA-Seq data
### Go to "File" > "Load from file" and browse to the annotations folder and import 'MG8_ref.aug_species_mg.gff3' & 'MG8_ref.aug_species_af.gff3' as well as 'MG8_rnaseq_reads.bam'
### Inspect the results , what looks better in general ? 
### Obviously, one would like to get a better feel of specificity and accurateness, but that is beyond the scope of this workshop 
### For those interested, GenomeTools (genometools.org) contains a function to calculate some of this, i.e. gt_eval

## finished >> quick demonstration using WebApollo
